## Installation

1. If you don't have it already, install git from https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Open a command prompt window
3. Type `cd (directory where you want to put the app)` and press enter
4. Run the command below in a command prompt.

`git clone https://github.com/andivis/solid-invention.git`

## Instructions

1. Open `directory where you want to put the app`
2. Open the file called `input.csv` in a spreadsheet program or text editor. Edit the file as needed. The `craigslist ad must contain` is a semi-colon separated list of phrases. At least one of those phrases must appear in the Craigslist ad.
3. Double click `marketplaces.bat`. It'll write a link to itself in `C:\Users\(your username)\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`. This allows the app to launch on system startup.
5. Optionally, double click `show-hide-window.bat` to hide/show the command prompt window
